# Escape_the_Room_Generator
Playing around with Rust and procedurally generating escape the room games.

This is built with Cargo, so cargo build is all this is needed to build the projects (or cargo run to build and run the binary).

Currently the binary requires that the "res" folder is in the same folder as it is run from, so I would suggest creating a symlink from the target/debug
directory to the res folder if building from this repo.

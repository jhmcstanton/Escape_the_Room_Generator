Why would you do that? Harsh. It broke. Great.
You... you just broke it..
It smashes all over the floor.
It cracks as you smash into it.
It breaks apart.
It explodes across the room.
It shatters into tiny, little pieces.
What did it do to deserve that?
Why did you have to go and do that? Poor thing.

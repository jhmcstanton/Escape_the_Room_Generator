It's broken on the floor.
It's in pieces now.
That's not very useful now.
I doubt that will hold much in this state.
There are pieces everywhere.
Why would you do that? It didn't hurt anyone, but you broke it.
It's empty now. Empty and dead.
Welp, no one's going to use this anymore.
It's broken and empty.
It's empty.
It's gone now. Gone.
